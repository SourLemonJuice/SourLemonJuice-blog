In the whole 2025 I'm always trying to be more outside. Meet more strangers and feel more fleeting gazes.\
Maybe I'm already get ready for more long travels? I really want to meet more friends in the different cities. Can I really do it?

Whisper: *someone said I'm cute ^=^*

## On designs

After Google's [Material Design 3 Expressive](https://youtu.be/n17dnMChX14), Apple released their new design system [Liquid Glass](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/06/apple-introduces-a-delightful-and-elegant-new-software-design/). Now the whole world is shifting to using more and more glass effects. But people(customers) love glass, so I accept this fed.\
But overall, they are all way better than linux desktops. qwq

Emm, another thing is that Nothing(a company name) will release a new flagship android phone: Phone (3)\
It will not released until July, so now there's nothing fun to talk about.

Speaking of Nothing, I switched my system and editor fonts recently.\
For monospace font the choice is still [Monaspace(by GitHub Next)](https://monaspace.githubnext.com) but using different family: `Argon` -> `Xenon`. Also means sans-serif to serif.\
I'm discovering serif font recently.
Nothing is famous precisely because their graph and hardware designs, why not use their font directly? For that I find this repository: [Yokilleurs/NothingFonts](https://github.com/Yokilleurs/NothingFonts).

But be honest, unlike my previous choice Google Sans, their fonts are not quite so generic. So compact, so artistic. The system UI font still required sans-serif fonts.\
But I used NType Mono for my window title. That doesn't matter, dose it? Reasonable sacrifice for art:

I think that's all.

## Development

In June 2025, I only created 23 commits on github. I haven't focused on programming since April.\
However, Now I have a long-standing repository of my solutions to algorithm problems: [SourLemonJuice/algorithm-problems-archive](https://github.com/SourLemonJuice/algorithm-problems-archive).

## Games

I didn't spend too much time on gaming, but I did want to finish OneShot in July.

One big change is about Heroic Games Launcher, a great manager for linux gaming. I migrated all my "Non-Steam Game" to Heroic, easy to open winecfg, explicit wine prefix path. That's way more useful.

> "Non-Steam Game" referred to pirated games, but it also covered regular windows apps(e.g. NetEase Cloud Music).

And... I finally switched my Steam UI language to English. :)\
I'm really concerned about cultural issues... The publisher set up the different marketing materials for each language zone, even some game covers are also different.\
I... don't know.

## Ending

I missed someone's invitation and let their down. I'm sorry for that, if you can see this.\
Maybe I should plan for only next two weeks?

Even though the pride month has ended, I think I'll still keep that rainbow emoji on some of my messaging platforms.\
Why not, especially at today.
