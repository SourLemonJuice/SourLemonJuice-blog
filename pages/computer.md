## Programming Language

- Shell Script:\
    To be exact, it's bash script.\
    Because the Linux.

- The ISO C Programming Language:\
    Still learning?\
    But I should have learned a lot already.

- JavaScript:\
  [SourLemonJuice/Redirect-Worker](https://github.com/SourLemonJuice/Redirect-Worker) is a CloudFlare Worker for redirecting HTTP requests, I think it has made me realize the strange syntax of JS...

- C++:\
    Just starting to learn.

- Kotlin:\
  Only learned a little bit, but it's interesting. It's very... comfortable?

- Java:\
    Learned a **little** before.\
    I was thinking for writing mods for Minecraft at the time.\
    But... I didn't work it out.

- Todo:
  - TypeScript
  - Python

## Code Style

- C/C++
  - [.clang-format](https://gist.github.com/SourLemonJuice/047f051f2d6365aed547826d22b2a516)
  - [Linux kernel coding style](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html) no naming
  - [Google C++ Style Guide #Naming](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Naming) and some other little stuff
  - [LLVM Coding Standards #The High-Level Issues](https://llvm.org/docs/CodingStandards.html#the-high-level-issues)
  - Still exploring, probably

- Markdown
  - [markdownlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint) in VSCode

- JavaScript
  - [.prettierrc.yaml](https://gist.github.com/SourLemonJuice/8f0ec285fafe9bce38dd95d9fae5c349)

## Operating System

- **Half** `Linux` guy. For now it's `Archlinux`, maybe it will be `Fedora` in the future.
- Microsoft `Windows`... Easy to use, but not simple. I'm never hate it.
- Forever rejecting `macOS` and `Apple`.
- Weird `ChromeOS`, but it's funny and useful.

## GUI Visual Design

- **Material Design 3/Material You** forever!
- **Microsoft Design Language/Microsoft Metro** is also good, I still like straight corners a bit more.
- And some Others.

## Linux Distribution

My first distro is Ubuntu, that's the end of 2022(probably around this?), like almost anyone, it's difficult. I'm using the desktop version but use it as a server. It's just because I have an idle old computer.\
This is fun, but useless as a server.

Nearly more than six months later, I started to try to use Linux as my main system, and that's when I chose Debian.\
It was the right choice and I spent another six months or so learning computer on Debian, it's really really stable.\
Finally, in 2023/08 I spent a whole night migrating them to Archlinux, until now.

## IDE(Integrated development environment)

Really long name...

Just using Visual Studio Code, terminal and text editor is enough for now...\
In daily life Kate/KWrite(GUI), Micro(TUI) are pretty good too.

## Game Engine

Wait, I don't know how to make a game. Why am I talking about game engines?\
I just want to say: Fuck you Unity.

## Hardware

I'm really not good at this, so tired...

Oh right, no NVIDIA GPU(for game)!
